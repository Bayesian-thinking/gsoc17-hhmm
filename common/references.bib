  title    = {Ensemble Learning for Hidden Markov Models},
  year     = {1997},
  abstract = {The standard method for training Hidden Markov Models optimizes a point estimate of the model parameters. This estimate, which can be viewed as the maximum of a posterior probability density over the model parameters, may be susceptible to overfitting, and contains no indication of parameter uncertainty. Also, this maximummay be unrepresentative of the posterior probability distribution. In this paper we study a method in which we optimize an ensemble which approximates the entire posterior probability distribution. The ensemble learning algorithm requires the same resources as the traditional Baum--Welch algorithm. The traditional training algorithm for hidden Markov models is an expectation-- maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al. 1977) known as the Baum--Welch algorithm. It is a maximum likelihood method, or, with a simple modification, a penalized maximum likelihood method, which can be viewed as maximizing a posterior probability density over the model parameters. Recently, ...},

  title    = {Variational algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference},
  year     = {2003},
  abstract = {The Bayesian framework for machine learning allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge in a coherent way, avoids overfitting problems, and provides a principled basis for selecting between alternative models. Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a unified variational Bayesian (VB) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propaga-tion algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the VB EM al-gorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential (CE) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated VB derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the VB EM algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models.},
